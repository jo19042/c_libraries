# c_libraries
Libraries built to practice C. 

I'm two internships and countless coursework in. But I don't feel like I have
what I would clal a "good" handle on the C language, or even on certain data
structures and algorithms. 

Thus, the purpose of this project, to write/build different algorithms and data
structures and implement different features in C in order to practice and gain
a certain confidence in them.
